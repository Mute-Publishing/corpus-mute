# Corpus Mute

_— A project to catalogue and activate the Mute magazine archive_

Corpus Mute is a _cataloguing project_ for making the *[Mute](https://www.metamute.org/)* magazine archive using modern open scholarship workflows. The goals are to catalogue, explore, connect, and distribute Mute's writing and projects. The workflows use software tooling from the following areas — linked open data [(Wikidata)](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q115486583), knowledge graphs, open science infrastructures, and digital sovereign infrastructures. The results of the Corpus Mute endeavour will be accessible from well-established open scholarship platforms, including — [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/works?page=1&filter=title_and_abstract.search:mute+magazine), [Wikidata](https://reasonator.toolforge.org/?&lang=mul&q=6943763), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/mute), [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/@metamute?sort=title), [Library Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Genesis) and many more.

The project aims to profile and give recognition to all who helped create _Mute_ and generously gave their ideas, energy, and hard work: The editors and staff; contributors; those in our network — individuals, projects, and organisations; and to our supporters and funders. 

Mute is actively looking for supporters and partners. Please reach out if you're interested in a conversation about the archiving project.  

Coordinator: Simon Worthington, co-founder Mute simon@metamute.org

3. Sponsors: 4000 €;
4. Distributor discount: 1440 € (=40% discount).

*Supporters: If you had some sort of working relationship or involvement, as individuals or institutions, over Mute's working life then you're a supporter :-)

Postage and packing is extra, plus any taxes or import duties.

See [https://archive.metamute.org/](https://archive.metamute.org/) for purchasing details, a full list of print issues, and more information. Prices are shown in regional currencies.

Note: For Global South regions pricing is available based on purchasing power parity (PPP) indices — see: [Eurostat data](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?oldid=670267). PPPs convert different currencies into a common unit which equalizes their purchasing power and eliminates differences in price levels between economies. (Eurostat) Please get in contact directly for prices.

## The work

### Phase #1 (Oct-Dec 2025): Exploratory cataloguing and project scoping

#### Tasks

  - Design a data model for magazine issues and articles for use in knowledge graphs and LLMs. The first iteration would be a skeleton data model, built bottom up, to understand what could be included. The data model would be built in a Wikibase instance
  - Catalogue magazine issues with basic metadata in Wikidata, Wikibase Cloud, and Wikimedia Commons
  - Create sample persistent identifiers and evaluate their use: ROR, DOIs, ORCIDs, ConfIDent, etc.
  - Upload all magazine covers to Wikimedia Commons

### Archive status

Current status: Pre-release

Below are some sample views into Mute's open scholarship data records. These are the types of repositories that the project will distribute to:

  - [Zenodo - sample article](https://zenodo.org/communities/mute)
  - [Wikidata - top level organisation record](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6943763)
  - [Wikimedia Commons - media uploads](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Mute)
  - [Research Organization Registry (ROR) - organisation Persistent identifier](https://ror.org/002g5jp68)
